<h4><b>Recap of the 1996 DN North American Championship -
February 11-12, 1996<br>
</b><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>by Ken Van Wagnen US4111</b></font></h4>

<p>We started out believing the 1996 North American Championship
Regatta would be sailed on the same piece of ice we had been
practicing on for eight weeks straight - Anchor Bay at the north
end of Lake St. Clair near Detroit Michigan. As registration
opened on Thursday evening, the rains poured on what had been
18" of great ice for the last two months. The plan called
for a small amount of "zamboni" action. The area
received far too much rain. On Friday as the fleet practiced on
the racing area, it became apparent the rain had caused too much
damage. The forecast was for warmer temperatures the next day so
off we drove Saturday morning (2/10) to Burlington Vermont to
sail on Mallets Bay, Lake Champlain.</p>

<p><b>Day One</b><br>
Racing began Sunday morning. What a great morning it was!
Temperature in the low 30's and a beautiful breeze took us out to
the middle of a hugh piece of near-perfect ice. It had snowed
maybe one half inch the night before which gave off an
interesting sensation that you were not moving very fast. Even
though you were smoking along at warp, the snow cover took away
the sensation of speed. You did not feel how fast you were going
until you crossed tacks with someone or met an upwind/downwind
situation. We were flying!</p>

<p>The wind decided to take a break at start time (10am) so
everyone had a chance to make final adjustments and visit with
their friends. The wind filled in after and hour or two and we
were lined up in a good breeze that appeared to be steadying out
for the day.</p>

<p><b>Race one</b><br>
I stood on the starting line in the #14 spot on the left side of
the course. My thoughts centered on the confidence I had
developed racing with the Michigan crowd over the past two
months. With more than 50 races and many hours of sailing during
that period, I felt really good about my potential. The wind was
in the low teens and the course was a good long mile of
near-perfect ice with the dusting of wet snow. I had a good start
and got up to speed quickly. I rounded 4th behind Paul Goodwin (4061),
Ron Sherry (44) and Chip Cartwright (118). The race progressed
with myself, Sherry and Cartwright trading places. Paul Goodwin
performed the only true horizon job of the regatta. At the finish
it was Goodwin first by a bunch, Sherry second, Van Wagnen third,
Cartwright fourth and Jan Gougeon (1183) fifth.</p>

<p><b>Race two</b><br>
I started in the three spot below Sherry and above Gougeon. The
wind was building and the day was panning out to be a classic
iceboat racing day. Good breeze, great ice, and a large course to
stretch out on. I concentrated on having a good start and getting
the boat up to warp as soon as possible. I was becoming more
confident with my starting ability. I confirmed that confidence
when we started and Sherry could not roll me with his near
flawless starting ability. I was also able to slowly grind over
Gougeon who may have been being held a bit high by the next
sailor down the line. I held right and tacked at the starboard
layline. At the first weather mark is was Sherry first,
Cartwright second, Mike O'Brien (3456) third with Danny Connell
(1630) and myself overlapped in fourth and fifth. O'Brien and
Cartwright traded places rolling each other off to the right side
of the downwind leg. I jibed early into a puff that carried me
down to the leeward mark and into second behind Sherry. Cartwright
ground me down on the next lap and we finished in that order.
Sherry first, Cartwright second, Van Wagnen third, Connell fourth
and O'Brien fifth.</p>

<p><b>Race three</b><br>
Bigger wind! What an excellent day! My confidence continued to
build. I started below Sherry and above O'brien in the number
three spot, concentrating on a smooth start. It worked again as I
was able to keep Sherry off my windward shoulder and sail high
enough to keep to weather of O'Brien and the rest of the line up.
My boat speed was excellent and I was beginning to feel I could
point just a bit higher than anyone around me. This was a
pleasant surprise compliments of a slight sail shape adjustment
Skip Boston had made for the fiberglass mast group. The left side
came into the weather mark better and I rounded about ninth
coming in on the starboard layline over stood in what was the biggest
wind of the day (puffs to maybe 18-22) eased out and flying low.
I decided not to follow the crowd off to the right downwind so I
jibed back into the puff which carried me almost directly back to
the leeward mark. I felt the puff let up about 2/3's of the way
down the leg so I jibed back and found myself in second behind
Cartwright at the first leeward mark. Cartwright led this one
wire to wire. I was second followed by Connell in third, O'Brien
fourth and Eric Loenneke (338) fifth. At this point Cartwright
led the regatta with a 4-2-1. I was 1/4 point back with a 3-3-2.
Sherry and Goodwin did not recover from the teens in this race
which gave Cartwright and myself a small cushion going into the
fourth race.</p>

<p><b>Race four</b><br>
I was standing in a starting spot I never stood in at a North
American Championship. I was 1/4 point from the lead and the wind
was going light. Oh No! I've got my "full metal jacket"
heavy inserts on all the way around and my plank is one hole
forward of where I set it for light air. There was still a sailing
breeze but it was nowhere near the velocity we had enjoyed
earlier. I pulled my halyard up inch (mostly for my head) and
started left with O'brien below. Mike held me off as we got up to speed
but I was happy to see not much had changed. I was sailing pretty
evenly with him the first couple of minutes. I tacked to port and
as I picked up speed and a lifting puff I noticed the right side must
not have had good breeze. Our side was clearly ahead. I rounded
first without a clue as to who was behind me (I knew O'Brien was
there but not sure who else). I carried off to the right and got lifted.
When I jibed back to the middle, I found Jeff Kent had passed me
by using the same puff area I used in the third race. On the
second lap we traded tacks. I came out on top at the second
weather mark only to carry off to the right again and have Kent
pass me again by using the left side puff. My speed and pointing
were good and I was able to sneak by Kent at the third weather
mark. This time down I realized I needed to cover the middle so I
jibed back to the center. It worked and when I jibed again for
the finish line there was no one in sight to my right. I had just
won my first race in a major DN event. The top five rounded out
with Cartwright second, Sherry third, Kent fourth and Gary Knapp
(4628) fifth.</p>

<p><b>Day two</b><br>
The forecast was for temperatures to fall into single digits and
the wind NW 15-25mph with higher gusts. By 9am the temperature
was 3 to 5 degrees and the wind was definitely up. Race Chairman Bill
Van Gee deemed "by the powers vested in me, this regatta is
complete". By using the tie breaker system to separate my
nine points from Chip Cartwright's nine points, I had won my
first major iceboat event since I began racing DNs in 1968/69.</p>

<p>Special thanks to my father Bob Van Wagnen who was an active
DN sailor until about 1973 and who introduced me to iceboating in
1968. Also to my wife Maureen and son Greg for allowing me the
freedom to "follow the ice" all winter. To Ron Sherry
and the Michigan crowd for providing great tuning sessions. And
to my teammates and traveling companions Dennis Butts (3868),
Nick Vitale (1006), Scott Root (738), and Dick Parker (4738) for
their support and for helping take some of the administrative
load off during registration. Thank you all!</p>
