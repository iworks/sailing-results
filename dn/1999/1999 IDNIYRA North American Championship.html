<center><h3>NORTH AMERICAN CHAMPIONSHIP<br>
February 25 &amp; 26, 1999</h3>
<h4>Lac St. Louis, Quebec, Canada</h4>
</center>

<i>by Paul Goodwn - US 4061</i>
<p>
The North American Championship was held immediately after the World Championship on a large piece of ice
in Montreal, Canada.  The wind was not very cooperative on the first day, but the mini-qualifiers were held, as well
as the first Gold fleet race.  The first race for Silver fleet was started in light snow, which soon turned into a total
white out during a sudden snow squall.
</p><p>
The next day of racing was started in light but fairly steady wind, which built to around 10 knots during the afternoon.
This provided excellent racing, with 6 races in Gold and Silver fleets, and 5 races in Bronze Fleet.  There were a few
collisions, mostly in the afternoon as the ice softened up a little, but there were no injuries.
</p><p>
The racing was very competetive in all of the fleets, especially at the top of the Gold fleet.  Karol Jablonski and Ron Sherry
waged a major battle for first place, with Karol in the lead up until the first throwout which let Ron dump a 14 from the second
race and created a tie for first place.  In the sixth race Ron beat Karol to take the lead.  The race committee tried to get
a seventh race at the end of the day, but the wind shifted 30 degrees at the last minute, and there was not enough time to
change the course before sundown.  Later I asked Karol if another race would have given him a chance to take the
title, and he replied "No way! That Ron Sherry is too f_____ fast!"
</p><p>
Debbie Sherry made an interesting observation - the ranking point spread in Gold fleet was 23 (from 1 to 24), but the ranking
spread in Silver fleet was only 15 (from 25 to 40).  This was clearly seen out on the course, because the Silver fleet sailed
in a large group with very little spread between the first and last boats - even at the end of the last lap.  This made the Silver 
fleet very competetive, and the racing was exciting to watch.

<i>A unique personal experience</i>
<p>
I had a rather unique experience  this regatta - after wrecking my boat by dropping a runner in a crack before the first race,
I borrowed a boat form one of the Silver fleet sailors.  The boat I was going to use was finishing near the end of the Silver
fleet before making any changes, and I was interested to see if the boat could be tuned up and sailed competetively in
the Gold fleet.  The intention was to sail this boat, tune it up to Gold fleet standards, and the owner would then be able to 
sail his boat in the Silver fleet and benefit form my tuning.  In the first race I didn't make any changes to the boat just to see 
how it would perform.  I had a good start and rounded the weather mark around 30th place.  I maintained my position 
somewhat during the downwind leg, and only lost a few boats.  After rounding the leeward mark I had problems with the boat
because the runners were dull, and the sail was poorly matched to the mast - by the end of the race I finished in 42nd place.
</p><p>
The next race I put my own runners on the boat and aligned them carefully.  I also made a few small changes to the rigging to
try and get the boat to point a little higher.  I had another good start and I was in decent shape at the weather mark, but I still 
could not keep up with the other boats downwind, or upwind once I rounded the leeward mark and had to sail "in the pack".
The boat would not get up to warp, but it had a decent "feel" and I thought there was still a lot of room for improvement.  
I managed to hold my position somewhat, but ran over something on the layline to the weather mark on the last lap, and it
trashed the edge on my port runner.  I lost several boats downwind and finished 37th, which was still an improvement over the 
previous race.
</p><p>
I noticed that the sail (an old Bosset wide range) did not set well on the "Whip" - at full speed the top of the sail was quite
full, and the bottom (at the lowest full length batten) was pulled completely flat.  My next change was to put my four year old
Boston "FO1" sail on the boat, and I moved the plank three inches forward.  The rigging could not be adjusted properly - the mast 
had too much back rake, and the sail had to be hoisted to the top of the mast.  I went for a test sail and could tell the boat
had potential since I was finally able to get it up to full "warp" speed, and was ready for the next race.  I had another decent start
and the boat sailed well upwind.  I got to the weather mark in the high teens, and was upwind of all the other boats going
into the rounding.  As I approached the mark, there was a large group on the layline, with several boats approaching on
port tack.  I was sailing a borrowed boat, so I stayed 5 or 6 boat lengths upwind of the pack for safety reasons.  A boat
came through the pack on port tack, causing one of the starboard tack boats to swerve to weather to avoid a collision.  Both
the port and starboard tack boats were able to stay clear of each other and turned back towards the mark - I was glad that I 
had left distance between me and the other boats.  As I started to peel off around the mark, the starboard tack boat was 
still trying to regain control of his boat, and eventually spun out to weather.  I tried to turn to avoid him, but he came up and
hit me in the side in front of the mast step.  Both boats were destroyed and ended my experimentation with the silver fleet
boat.
</p><p>
I felt that the boat was capable after making a few changes, and it was unfortunate the Silver fleet sailor was not able to
benefit from my tuning.  After my first couple of changes the boat speed had improved noticeably, but I ran over something
which ruined the edge on one runner, and we did not have time to change it before the start of the next silver fleet race.
After the final changes, I wrecked his boat so he wasn't even able to finish the regatta.  The only significant changes were
the runners and the sail.  His runners (maximum T's) probably would have been fine if they had been sharpened properly.
The sail did not match the mast, and was actually made to fit an aluminum mast.  Otherwise it was a matter of adjusting
the rig, and Ron supplies a good set of rigging instructions with the purchase of a "Whip" mast - which this sailor had.
</p><p>
All in all it was an enlightening experience and I learned from it, unfortunately at the cost of two hulls.
