      <h2 align="center">2001 IDNIYRA North American Championship</h2>
      <p><i>by Paul Goodwin - US 46</i></p>
      <p>The North American Championship was held immediately after the World 
        Championship on Saginaw Bay, MI. There was a large pan of ice on the bay, 
        allowing for courses close to one mile long for all of the races. There 
        was a little bit of pressure on the Race Committee because the Coast Guard 
        informed us that an ice breaker would come through the bay on Sunday, 
        and all boats were required to be off the ice. That only allowed for two 
        days of racing. The Race Committee did a fine job, and got in four races 
        for each fleet on Friday, and three more on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The area for the first day of racing was 5 miles offshore from the launch 
        site, and the day started with fog and no wind. Around noon the wind started 
        to pick up, and we left downwind for the course in light but sailable 
        winds and some fog. Well, the wind wasn't <i>really</i> light, but it 
        felt like it when you were carrying 50 lbs. of gear in your cockpit! We 
        were told the course was located close to where we sailed the last day 
        of the Worlds, so we had an idea of where to go. About 3 miles offshore 
        the location was still not visible, and the shoreline at the launch was 
        disappearing too, so I stopped to get my bearings. Mike Rehe also stopped, 
        and luckily had the previous day's location stored on a GPS. Only another 
        1-1/2 miles to go!</p>
      <p>The racing got underway quickly, and the first four races were sailed 
        in moderate wind. A 1/2" layer of crusty snow on the surface of the 
        ice made for slow going at times, although you couldn't tell by watching 
        Karol sail the course. Karol lead the Gold Fleet's first race, and set 
        the tone for the rest of the regatta. The wind picked up significantly 
        for the third Gold Fleet race, putting smiles on most faces (isn't it 
        fun to go fast!). Ron Sherry and Meade Gougeon put some pressure on Karol 
        during the first day of racing, but Karol was always ahead where it counts 
        - at the finish line. Greg Smith and John Harper were also sailing strong 
        consistent races, making for some exciting racing.</p>
      <p>In the Silver Fleet, Jim Grogan and Andre Baby sailed a really close 
        race (after an initial deep-in-the-fleet finish by Andre in the first 
        race). Duane McDaniels and Guy Lovejoy were also showing some strong finishes 
        on the first day.</p>
      <p>The second day had clear blue skies and 17+mph winds in the morning. 
        Getting out to the course was no challenge at all, and my little GPS recorded 
        35mph boatspeed on the downwind run out to the course. The top six boats 
        in Gold Fleet were really mixing it up (with the exception of Karol, who 
        finished with all bullets), and places changed frequently during the laps. 
        Matt Struble and Paul Goodwin came on strong after the wind had picked 
        up, insuring a couple spots in the trophy presentation.</p>
      <p>Silver Fleet was dominated on Saturday by Jim Grogan, but Andre Baby 
        never let up on the pressure. It was fun watching the rest of the fleet 
        race because the competition was so close. Duane McDaniels, Pete Johns 
        and Guy Lovejoy battled hard on the course, and Scott Root, Mark Isabell, 
        and Bill Coberly rounded out a very competitive group at the top of Silver 
        Fleet.</p>
      <p>With two days of great racing on the biggest piece of ice I've ever sailed 
        on, it just doesn't get much better. Hats off to the Race Committee, who 
        were working late at night, and on the ice every day before most sailors 
        were eating breakfast, trying to provide the best racing experience possible. 
        Hot food was available on the ice after racing, and the friendly atmosphere 
        brought 11 countries together to share a truly enjoyable regatta.</p>
