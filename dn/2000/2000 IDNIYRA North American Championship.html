March 3, 2000</h3>

<h4 align="center">Lake Miltona, Minnesota</h4>
<i>

<p>by Paul Goodwn - US 4061</p></i> 

<p>The 2000 NA's were postponed 3 times due to poor weather forecasts.&nbsp; The regatta
was finally sailed at Lake Miltona, Minnesota. This puts a new pin in the map as the
farthest West a national regatta has ever been sailed.&nbsp; The Governing Group worked
hard at finding a suitable site, but was frustrated by poor ice and weather conditions,
and was forced to postpone for several weeks.</p>

<p>The final decision to hold the race in Minnesota was a difficult one, and many sailors
from the Eastern regions were unable to make the long trip.&nbsp; Unfortunately this meant
the turnout was small for a National event.&nbsp; Forty-seven boats made the final trip to
Lake Miltona.</p>

<p>The ice was a pebbly snow ice, with a large area free of cracks or other hazards.
&nbsp; The morning of the first race wind was light and variable, but after a short delay
the wind settled down and allowed the regatta to get under way.&nbsp; The weather was not
the best, with temperatures close to 60 deg F, and winds of 5-10 MPH.</p>

<p>Jan Gougeon let everyone see his mastery of variable conditions by leading the fleet in
all four Gold fleet races on Friday.&nbsp; The ice was hard in the morning, and turned
quite soft by the afternoon.&nbsp; John Harper and Bruce Williams were trying hard to
catch Jan, but he was unbeatable (with a lead of over 1-1/2 minutes in one race).&nbsp; It
was also great to see the area Rear Commodore (John Davenport), break into Gold fleet and
finish in the top ten under the trying conditions.</p>

<p>There was some good racing in the Silver fleet, with Butch Babcock and Bob Theissen
trading positions during the day, making it impossible to predict a winner until the
racing was done.&nbsp; Butch finally took the trophy home, but it was a hard fought win.
&nbsp; It's great to see two seasoned sailors (both masters), sailing well and providing a
strong lead for the rest of the fleet.</p>

<p>The ice softened and deteriorated rapidly with the unusually warm temperatures.
&nbsp; Several sailors went over holes without even realizing it, and unfortunately Jane
Pegel found one too big to sail over and destroyed her plank in the last Silver fleet
race.&nbsp; The racing was concluded for the day after that, and the overnight
temperatures stayed above freezing.&nbsp; Sunday's forecast was for even higher
temperatures, and light and variable winds.&nbsp; With the temperature forecast for 65
degF Sunday, the Race Committee wisely concluded the regatta on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>The race committee drove all the way from the Mountain Lakes region, and ran an
excellent regatta.&nbsp; I can't say enough about the dedication it takes for a group of
volunteers to travel 24 hours, and still get to the ice before 7:30 am to check the
conditions and set a course.&nbsp; Their dedication and training really shows in how
smoothly the regatta proceeded.&nbsp; Many thanks to Bill VanGee and his crew.</p>
