<p>The annual Northwestern regatta was sailed on Geneva Lake, WI, 
February 27, 28, March 1st, 2009.   The fast ice conditions could be rated an 8.  
The shifty north wnds kept everyone alert.   Racing was delayed on Friday 
with steady 24 mph gusting to over 30 during the morning but when it settled 
down the each class completed two races before the end of the day.  
On Saturday the wind was more moderate, and actually died before all fleets 
got two races, but the DNs, first in the rotation completed races three and four.  
Sunday the wind was again a steady 24 mph with gusts to 30 mph and the plug was 
pulled at 9:30 a.m.     Sailors who ventured out after the awards ceremony reported 
shifty blasts, but they got some super fast rides.</p>

<p>Sam, who weighs 100 lbs, was in-the-hunt when he lost a mitten.  He sailed two laps 
bare handed before retiring.  Mark my words,  this kid is going to be a winner. </p>
