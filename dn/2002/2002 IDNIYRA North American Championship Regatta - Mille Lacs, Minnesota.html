      <h2>2002 North American Championship Regatta</h2>



      <p>The 2002 North American Championship was held at Mille Lacs, Minnesota on 
January 26th and 27th.  Ninety sailors came from from as far away as Marthas Vineyard, North Carolina, 
and New Mexico to attend the Regatta. Mille Lacs is a large lake, and the ice was thick enough 
(20+ inches) to allow the sailors to drive trailers onto the ice. Not only were we able to drive trailers 
onto the ice, we were able to drive to the starting line to set our boats up! This was a first for all 
the sailors I talked to, and it was really enjoyable to be able to sit in the car and warm up between 
races. The ice was mostly smooth and 85% clear, but was dotted with sticky snow drifts up to a 
couple inches deep. This resulted in racers looking for the best lanes through the snow patches 
when the wind was light, just like the Western Regional Championship.</p>

      <p>The ninety boats were divided into two fleets (50 Gold and 40 Silver). Racing got under way 
on Saturday with very light winds.  The first mini-qualifier was a bust after the lead boat failed to make 
the time limit. After waiting for the wind to build a little, the Silver mini-qualifier was successfully completed. 
The wind did not cooperate for the rest of the day, and only the one race was completed on Saturday.</p>
      
      <p>On Sunday, the racers were greeted with good wind in the morning, and everyone was tuning 
their boats for the increasing wind. This was a fleeting bit of excitement however, since the wind lightened 
up by the time a course was set. The first Gold Fleet race was pretty tough going for a lot of sailors, with 
wind shifts and lulls making it a bit of a crap shoot. However, John Dennis seemed to be able to sniff out 
the zephyrs and showed us that he still knows how to sail by finishing in time to park his boat and watch 
the second place boat finish!  John was followed by Ron Sherry, Greg Smith, and Matt Struble, setting 
the stage for the battle at the top of Gold Fleet.</p>

      <p> The wind lightened further, and it was a depressing sight for most of the day as boats were 
parked facing all directions and not a single telltale was flying. Late in the afternoon. the wind suddenly 
filled in from the opposite direction, and the Race Committee hustled to set a new course and get the 
sailors on the starting line.</p>

      <p>In order to insure a successful regatta, the Race Committee decided to start another Gold Fleet 
race.  This race was held in freshening winds, and there were a lot of smiling faces once again. Ron 
Sherry sailed an excellent race to finish first, followed by Matt Struble.  Greg Smith passed Paul Goodwin 
just before the finish line, and Bernd Zieger, John Harper, and Bruce Williams followed in close succession. 
Meade Gougeon put on a show for the spectators when he did a full spin right before the leeward mark, 
demonstrating the awareness and control that iceboaters have since everyone was able to steer clear 
and not a single splinter was left behind.</p>

      <p>As the second Silver fleet race started a very light sprinkle of rain developed, and the racers 
looked more like snowmen than sailors as they crossed the finish line. A few sailors chose to stop racing 
due to icing on their goggles and sail windows, but there were no collisions on the course. Rick Lemberg Sr. 
sailed a great race, and finished with a respectable lead. Rick Kaiser came in second, followed by Ken Mitchell. 
When I talked to Rick Kaiser later, he said he couldn't see the marks, so he just followed the boat in front of him.  
The good news was -- that boat was the leader!.</p>

      <p>The Race Committee waited to see what was going to happen with the rain, and used the time to 
reset the course.  Bart Reedijk had an excellent idea, and sent one of the Silver Fleet sailors up to the 
weather mark in his car.  The headlights helped the sailors locate the weather mark, and it was soon 
decided that it would be prudent to try to get a third Gold Fleet race in to insure that the regatta 
would be complete.</p>

      <p>The wind was good, but there was still a slight mist which made visiblility somewhat poor.  The 
good news is, all the sailors stayed on their toes and left plenty of room, so there were no collisions.  Ron 
Sherry sailed another nice race to finish in the lead, followed by Greg Smith and Bryan Breiden. 
Next in line were a couple Swamp Rats, Matt Struble and Jan Gougeon. It must be good training to dodge 
cattails and reeds during practice, since the Gougeons and Strubles are always in the hunt at the big regattas.</p>

      <p>Overnight the temperatures dropped to below zero (Fahrenheit), and it looked like an arctic air mass 
coming down from Canada would prevent the temperatures from getting into the double digits. The low 
temperatures coupled with some stealthy cracks in the ice lead the Race Committee to decide to throw in 
the towel and let the sailors start the long drive home.</p>

      <p>Once again the Race Committee did a fine job.  Dan Heaney, Debbie Goodwin, and Jane Sherry were 
the Race Committee, and with the aid of a lone volunteer managed to make the whole process look easy. The 
scoring was handled quickly and efficiently, which is more of an accomplishment than most racers realize. 
With the introduction of the "Bart Rule", results are much more fair for the sailors, but it creates a great 
challenge for the scorers. Bob Pegel was on hand to act as the Chief Judge and handle any protests, 
but luckily there were none.</p>

      <p>This was a fun regatta to attend, even though there were only a few races.  It was gratifying to see 
so many sailors make the committment to get out to Minnesota for the regatta, and all agreed that it was better 
than postponing in the hopes of finding a different venue.</p><p>
